    "#Ans  database is a collection of organized data that is stored and managed on a computer system. It allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of large amounts of data. A database system typically consists of software that manages the data, a database server that stores the data, and one or more applications that access the data. It is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It can be a physical or a digital storage system where data is stored in tables, documents, key-value pairs, or graphs, depending on the type of database."
